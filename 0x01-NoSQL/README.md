## About

NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that provide flexible and scalable solutions for managing and storing large volumes of unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data. Unlike traditional relational databases, NoSQL databases do not enforce a fixed schema and provide a more dynamic and flexible data model. In this project, we will interact with one of the most common NoSQL database out here that alot of developers like to use, MongoDB
